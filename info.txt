ABROAD COMPASS APP

HOW THIS APP WORKS
-------------------

1. Country & Season Selection:
--------------------------------
-> Users must select a country and a season (fall, spring, summer, winter) to view relevant products (clothes and food).
-> If the user fails to select either or both, an error message will be displayed after they click on "Go" button.

2. Dynamic Content Rendering:
-------------------------------
-> After selecting a country and season, 5 images for the selected season and country will be displayed.
-> The countries available are: Canada, France, Germany, and the USA.
-> Each country and season combination displays 5 images with the corresponding clothes and food.

3. Product Details:
--------------------
-> Each image represents a product (clothing or food) with:
    -> Product name
    -> Price range
-> A small info icon appears on the right side of the image for each product.
-> On hovering the info icon, a tooltip will display the benefits of the product.

4. Product Selection:
----------------------
-> When the user clicks on a product, it turns green to indicate it has been selected.
-> A "Get Selected Item" button will pop up after a product is selected.
-> Users can click the "Get Selected Item" button to view their selected products.

5. Scroll to Top Button:
--------------------------
-> An arrow button at the bottom right allows the user to scroll to the top of the page.
